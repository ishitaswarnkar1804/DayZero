**DayZero** is a gentle digital space for students who feel overwhelmed by noise, pressure, and constant comparison. It is not a productivity race .it is a calm system designed to help you reset, refocus, and survive academic life one day at a time. With themed study rooms, a peaceful library for PDFs, a personal notes vault, a private rant board, soft focus tools, and a daily streak that rewards showing up (not perfection), DayZero turns studying into a kinder experience. Everything is built to feel safe, quiet, and personal—so you can go slow, breathe, and keep moving forward in your own way.
