        <h2>What is DayZero?</h2>
        <p>
          DayZero is a calm digital space made for students who feel overwhelmed.
          It is not a productivity app. It is not a competition.
          It is a soft system to help you reset, refocus, and survive academic life
          one day at a time.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are no leaderboards. No pressure. No noise.
          Just rooms that help you think, breathe, study, write, and let things out.
        </p>
      </div>

        <div class="grid2">
          <div class="step">
            <strong>1. Login once</strong>
            <p>Your mood, goals, streak, and tasks are saved to your account.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="step">
            <strong>2. Pick a vibe</strong>
            <p>The theme you choose follows you across every room.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="step">
            <strong>3. Add tiny tasks</strong>
            <p>To-dos reset daily. Finished ones disappear. Unfinished ones stay.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="step">
            <strong>4. Show up</strong>
            <p>Your streak grows when you return. Miss a day? It resets gently.</p>
